# Das.Test
An opinionated unit testing library written in F# for F#.

# Motivation

I tried setting up testing project using [official dotnet link](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/main/core/getting-started/unit-testing-with-fsharp/MathService.Tests/MathService.Tests.fsproj) but got some obscure error for which I couldn't find any solution on the internet. Many other sources like [Scott Wlaschin's blog](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/low-risk-ways-to-use-fsharp-at-work-3) are too difficult to follow for someone like me who has never worked with C# or dotnet before.

So I said to myself to heck with it, let me create my own unit testing library.
